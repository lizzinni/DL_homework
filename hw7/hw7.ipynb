    "# Выводы:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Видим, что наибольная accuracy получилась для zero-shot. Это происходит по нескольким причинам. При few-shot в промпте сразу несколько примеров, и итоговая длина может превышать ограничение. Из-за этого промт усекается, и модель не видит всех примеров, что снижает качество вывода. Когда в подсказке слишком много примеров, модель путается между ними и новым текстом, особенно в T5-small, где пропускная способность ограничена.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Заметим, что для категории Sci/Tech модель выдаёт Science. Это происходит потому, что модель не возвращает точные строки Sci/Tech, а генерирует ближайшее по смыслу слово (в этом случае Science). При попытке поиска точного совпадения с AG_LABELS Sci/Tech нижний регистр и формат не совпадают, поэтому такие ответы считаются некорректными. Но в реальности видно, что модель улавливает смысл новости.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. T5-small не обладает достаточной емкостью для запоминания сразу нескольких примеров и сложных инструкций. Zero-shot промт короче, и модель точнее фокусируется на инструкции. Если примеры few-shot случайно содержат мало репрезентативных статей для каждой категории (например, три примера с большими перекосами), модель плохо обобщает на новые статьи.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Идейно, можно улучшить качество вот так:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Можно сократить кол-во примеров до 1–2 (one-shot или two-shot).\n",
    "   * Можем явно указывать точный формат меток в описании задачи.\n",
    "   * Возможно нужна более крупная модель, чтобы увеличить емкость и глубже обрабатывать контекст few-shot.\n",
    "   * Еще мб помогло бы выбрать не случайные статьи, а какие-то тексты по всем 4 категориям.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Zero-shot промт короче и понятнее, поэтому T5-small лучше справляется без примеров. One-shot уже добавляет один образец, и производительность немного падает. Few-shot даёт слишком длинный, частично усечённый промт, что ухудшает качество.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. То есть, для совсем небольших моделей есть смысл брать one- или two-shot, а для few-shot использовать модели с большим количеством параметров.\n"
